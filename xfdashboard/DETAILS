xfdashboard provides a GNOME shell dashboard and macOS Mission Control (ExposÃ©
and Spaces) like interface for use with the Xfce desktop. It can be configured
to run with any keyboard shortcut and when executed provides an overview of
applications currently open enabling the user to switch between different
applications. The search feature works like Xfce's app finder which makes it
convenient to search for and start applications.
