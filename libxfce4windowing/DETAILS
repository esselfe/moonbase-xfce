cat << EOF
Libxfce4windowing is an abstraction library that attempts to present
windowing concepts (screens, toplevel windows, workspaces, etc.) in a
windowing-system-independent manner. Currently, X11 is fully supported,
via libwnck. Wayland is partially supported, through various Wayland
protocol extensions. However, the full range of operations available
on X11 is not available on Wayland, due to missing features in these
protocol extensions.
